This Project is a "Python" Based Network Packet Sniffer built using "Scapy"

It captures live network traffic and displays useful packet information such as 


1. Source and Destination IP Addresses 
2. Protocol Type (TCP , UDP , ICMP )
3. Port Numbers 
4. Payload data ( When available )


This Project helps in understanding network Protocols Packet Structures and data flow which are essential concepts in "Cyber Security" and "Penetration Testing "


Tools
