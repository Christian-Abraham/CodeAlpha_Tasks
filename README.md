###### CodeAlpha_Tasks ######

This repository contains all the projects and exercises I completed during my Code Alpha Cybersecurity Internship.
It showcases practical hands-on work in areas such as network sniffing, phishing awareness, and application security. Each task demonstrates applied knowledge of cybersecurity fundamentals, Python programming, and network analysis.

The goal of this repository is to highlight real-world skills gained through the internship, with clean, documented code that is ready for review by mentors and potential recruiters.
